**RWA Community Guidelines**

# About React Web App Community

It is a community of learners learning web application development using React and associated technologies. 

The members learn through hands-on development and collaboration. 

# Code of conduct

JAMStack code of conduct (https://jamstack.org/code-of-conduct/) is a fair representative until we draft our own.


# Communication Guidelines

* all project specific communication on GitHub issues.
* All general communication on React-Web-Apps (RWA) Telegram group.

# Architecture Design approach

Web applications can be designed and architected in multiple ways. In our community, we would take the most modern yet few standardized approaches to design web applications. Instead of learning many ways, we would take a few fundamentally correct yet architecturally sound ways and go as much deeper. 

Once we learn to solve the problem in one correct way, learning other approaches become very easy.

Below are the key technology stack that we would be using in developing web apps:

**Front-end app**

* JAMStack architecture (https://jamstack.org/best-practices/)
* React based application architecture
* OAuth2 based authentication
* PWA application
* Backend call using REST API or GraphQL

**Back-end app**

* Node.js based REST API or GraphQL server
* PostgreSQL database
